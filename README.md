# Rail Lanka

Rail Lanka is a train enquiry system that combines a seat reservation system, an alert system, and a real-time train tracking feature. The goal is to provide a more efficient, reliable, and convenient platform for passengers and railway officials. 

The technologies used include __PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript__ for the web application and __Java, Android__ for the mobile application. We didn't use any frameworks to develop the system. 


The system is composed of 3 main sub-systems:

__1. Reservation System__ 

This system integrates online reservations with over-the-counter bookings. Registered passengers can search for the desired train, view the relevant seat map, and reserve seats by making payments online through PayPal. Passengers can also book tickets over the counter at selected stations by providing the necessary details to the reservation officer.

__2. Alert System__

The alert system enables moderators to provide passengers with real-time alerts related to delayed, canceled and, rescheduled trains. Registered passengers can also subscribe to receive these notifications via email.

__3. GPS Tracking System__

Throughout the train journey, drivers use a mobile app to share their live location. Passengers can track the live location of trains using the web app.
